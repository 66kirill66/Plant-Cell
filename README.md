# Plant Cell Simulation — Unity Code  

This repository contains the core Unity C# scripts used for the **"Plant Cell Simulation"** educational project.  
The simulation helps students learn about plant cell structures, water absorption, and cellular processes through interactive visualizations.  

## 🧩 Key Features of the Code:  
- Particle systems are used to simulate water and evaporation of water.
- Scriptable architecture for dynamic rule creation.
- Sprite-based animations are used for visual effects such as cell growth and structural changes.
- Localization support (English, Hebrew, Arabic).   
- Integration with external TypeScript API using `System.Runtime.InteropServices`.  

## 🔧 Technologies Used:  
- Unity 2021.3.30 (LTS)  
- C#  
- TextMeshPro for UI text rendering   
- WebGL for browser deployment  

## 📂 Note  
This repository contains only Unity scripts and core logic.  
The full simulation with assets and deployment resources is part of a private repository.
